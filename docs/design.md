# DAWN/AGNTCY Implementation Design

This document outlines the design of our implementation of the Cisco DAWN (Distributed Agents in a Worldwide Network) specification and how it relates to the AGNTCY framework.

## Overview of DAWN Architecture

DAWN (Distributed Agents in a Worldwide Network) is an architecture for distributed agent collaboration as described in the [DAWN paper](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.22339v2). The key components include:

1. **Principal Agent** - Central orchestrator and planner that:
   - Manages task planning, resource retrieval, and execution
   - Maintains a local resource pool
   - Uses reasoning strategies like ReAct for complex tasks

2. **Gateway Agents** - Globally distributed agents that:
   - Maintain registries of resources (tools, agents, applications)
   - Perform resource registration, testing, and retrieval
   - Enable global agent discovery and collaboration

3. **Architectural Layers**:
   - Orchestration Layer: Manages workflow and task execution
   - Communication Layer: Handles messaging between components
   - Context Layer: Manages memory and task context
   - Security, Safety, and Compliance Layer: Ensures system integrity

## Overview of AGNTCY Framework

AGNTCY (pronounced "agency") is an open collective building the Internet of Agents (IoA), which provides protocols and standards for agent-to-agent communication and interoperability. The framework is sponsored by Cisco, LangChain, Galileo, and other organizations.

The main components of the AGNTCY framework include:

1. **Agent Connect Protocol (ACP)** - A REST-based OpenAPI specification for invoking and configuring remote agents via API endpoints.

2. **Agent Gateway Protocol (AGP)** - A gRPC-based protocol for more efficient, real-time communication between agents with support for various patterns:
   - Request-Response
   - Publish-Subscribe
   - Fire-and-Forget
   - Streaming (unidirectional and bidirectional)

3. **Open Agent Schema Framework (OASF)** - A standardized data model for describing AI agents, ensuring consistent formatting of capability information and metrics.

## Key Design Principles

Our implementation will focus on adhering to these key principles:

1. **Interoperability**: Enable agents built with different frameworks to communicate seamlessly.
2. **Security**: Implement proper authentication, authorization, and encryption.
3. **Extensibility**: Design components to be easily extended or customized.
4. **Performance**: Optimize for efficient message passing and processing.

## Core Components

### 1. Agent Framework

The base implementation provides:
- Agent definition and lifecycle management
- Capability registration and discovery
- Message handling infrastructure

### 2. ACP Implementation

REST-based API implementation following the OpenAPI specification for:
- Agent configuration
- Agent invocation
- Response handling

### 3. AGP Implementation

gRPC-based implementation for efficient message passing:
- Supporting multiple message patterns
- Implementing security features
- Enabling streaming capabilities

### 4. Registry and Discovery

Implementation of agent registry for:
- Agent registration
- Capability-based discovery
- Network-based agent lookup

## Message Structure

Based on the AGNTCY framework, messages will include:

- Unique identifiers for messages and conversations
- Sender and recipient information
- Message content with appropriate typing
- Metadata for routing and processing
- Security information (authentication tokens, etc.)

## Security Model

Security will be implemented at multiple levels:

1. **Transport Security**: TLS/SSL for secure communication
2. **Authentication**: Verify identity of agents
3. **Authorization**: Control access to resources and operations
4. **Data Privacy**: Ensure sensitive information is protected

## Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Basic agent framework and message passing
2. **Phase 2**: ACP implementation with REST endpoints
3. **Phase 3**: AGP implementation with gRPC
4. **Phase 4**: Security and advanced features
